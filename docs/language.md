# Language Behavior

This reference records implemented behavior as language TODOs are completed. It is not yet the complete language specification required by the roadmap.

## Strings

Double quotes delimit a string; they are not part of its value. `"a" + "b"` produces the same value as `"ab"`. Strings preserve Unicode text without normalization and may contain literal newlines, pipes, comment markers, and braces.

Three escape sequences are supported:

| Source text | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `\n` | A newline |
| `\"` | A double quote |
| `\\` | A backslash |

Escapes are decoded once. For example, `"\\n"` contains a backslash followed by `n`; it does not contain a newline. Other escapes, including `\t`, are syntax errors. Map keys such as `label` in `{label: "hello"}` are identifiers; string decoding applies to the quoted value.

## Log Output

`Log |value|` writes the value followed by a newline to stdout and returns that value. Top-level strings are printed as their contents, including literal newlines. Numbers and booleans use plain text; the internal absent value displays as `none`.

Arrays use brackets and maps use braces. Nested strings and map keys are quoted with escaped newlines, quotes, backslashes, and other control characters. Map keys are sorted lexicographically for stable output: `Log |{z: 2, a: 1}|` prints `{"a": 1, "z": 2}`. This is a human-readable display format, not a serialization contract or a promise that every displayed value can be parsed as DSL source.

Output failures become evaluation errors. Errors are reported on stderr with a nonzero process status when uncaught. Pass `--debug` to the CLI to add top-level statement locations and kinds on stderr; it does not copy statement contents or trace nested execution. Normal logging remains on stdout.

## While Loops

`While |condition| { ... }` evaluates its boolean condition before each iteration, including the first. A false condition skips the body. Normal completion and `Continue` reevaluate the condition; `Continue` skips the rest of the current body. `Break` exits the loop immediately. A condition that is not boolean raises an evaluation error, including when its type changes during execution.

Nested `Return` propagation remains a tracked defect; the completed loop-iteration fix does not establish correct function-return behavior.
